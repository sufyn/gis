# GIS Project - SIH 2024 üåç

Welcome to the **GIS Project** repository for SIH (Smart India Hackathon) 2024! This project leverages Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and techniques to solve location-based challenges, focusing on efficient data visualization, analysis, and mapping.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources developed for SIH 2024. The primary tool used for this project is Jupyter Notebook, and the analysis was done using Python's geospatial libraries. The objective of this project is to address real-world problems using GIS and spatial data analysis, improving decision-making processes through geographical insights.

## Contents

- **sih_2024.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing code, data analysis steps, and visualizations created for this project. It includes:
  - Data loading and preprocessing.
  - Geospatial analysis and visualization.
  - Mapping using libraries like Folium and GeoPandas.
  
- **README.md**: Project overview and usage instructions.
